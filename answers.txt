Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
python dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq
GC-content: 0.43029262963

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_2.fastq
GC-content: 0.451051333333

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_3.fastq
GC-content: 0.646864112524

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_4.fastq
GC-content: 0.347852341166

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_5.fastq
GC-content: 0.263157894737

python dna_analysis.py data/sample_6.fastq
GC-content: 0.491518518519


Problem 3:

The variable (linenum) is not defined

If I comment out
    gc_count = 0
    
the script cannot print gc_content, which is now broken due to missing variable definitions.

Problem 4:

python dna_analysis.py data/test-small.fastq
GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7

Problem 5:
Number of G nucleotides: 1
Number of C nucleotides: 2

Reflection:

I think that my answer to number 6 is probably more verbose than you were looking for.
I left it in though, because I used it to evaluate my output and compare the data manually.
